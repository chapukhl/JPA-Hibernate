State news agency Yonhap said she had called for a "thorough investigation" into the scandal.
Mr Lee denies accepting 30 million won ($27,700; Â£18,600) in illegal campaign funds in 2013, but has come under pressure to stand down.
Under South Korean law, politicians cannot accept more than 100,000 won in contributions.
The scandal erupted when businessman Sung Wan-jong was found dead earlier this month in a suspected suicide. Mr Sung was about to be questioned by authorities over allegations that he embezzled company money to bribe politicians.
Investigators found a note in his pocket listing the names of several people, including Mr Lee, and numbers which appeared to indicate amounts paid to them.
An opposition party then called for Mr Lee''s impeachment.
Referring to Mr Lee''s resignation, Ms Park said in a written statement: "I find it regrettable. I also feel sympathy for the agony of the prime minister."
She is currently in Peru on a four-day state visit. Yonhap reported that she would decide on whether to accept Mr Lee''s resignation by next week.
Mr Lee has been in the job for only two months.
He filled the position after a protracted hunt for a candidate to replace his predecessor, Chung Hong-won.
Mr Chung resigned shortly after the Sewol ferry disaster in April 2014 that killed more than 300 people.

Mr Mohamed is confident that the AEC will soon rival the EU and could overtake it by 2025. He cited the 5%-plus economic growth rate of Asean, as compared to the 1-2% growth of the EU.
Still, there are numerous challenges facing the formation of the AEC. There aren''t many pan-regional institutions, for one.
Tony Fernandes, the chief executive of AirAsia, one of the few pan-Asean companies, called for a strong commission for the AEC. Instead of going to 10 different governments, he would like to see the equivalent of the European Commission in the AEC. Although, Mr Fernandes added, he would prefer a less bureaucratic version of the Commission in Asean.
Others, such as the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, have called for institutions to protect human rights and workers, including a court like the European Court of Justice.
That will be challenging, as political differences in the region - including numerous non-democratic states - will make it tough to integrate politically, as well as socially. Those are the two other unsurprising pillars of the AEC, which mirrors the development of European institutions, since tying markets together requires more than just economic agreements.

Mr Roberts is the founder of cybersecurity firm, One World Labs that tries to find vulnerabilities in IT systems and alert companies to them before they are exploited by criminals.
Last Wednesday, Mr Roberts was removed from another United flight by the FBI who took his laptop away, and questioned him for four hours.
As part of his job, Mr Roberts had given several interviews to the media in recent weeks in which he commented on the possible weak points of airline systems. He told Fox News:
"Quite simply put, we can theorise on how to turn the engines off at 35,000ft (10,668m) and not have any of those damn flashing lights go off in the cockpit."

Other plays in his inaugural season include Ibsen''s The Master Builder, starring Ralph Fiennes, and Pinter''s The Caretaker, with Timothy Spall.
Warchus is taking over from Kevin Spacey, the Old Vic''s artistic director for 11 years.
He said his first season - which also includes a stage adaptation of Dr Seuss''s The Lorax and a dance production of Jekyll and Hyde - reflected a "something for everyone" approach.
He aims to up the number productions per year through shorter runs, and hopes three or four will transfer to the West End or go direct to Broadway via a new partnership with big-name producers Scott Rudin and Sonia Friedman.
Groundhog Day reunites Warchus with three of the creative team behind the hit musical Matilda - composer and lyricist Tim Minchin, choreographer Peter Darling, and designer Rob Howell - who will work with the film''s co-writer Danny Rubin.
It tells the story of grumpy TV weatherman Phil Connors who is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, and gets stuck in a time loop, having to live the same day over and over again.

In an interview with the BBC, Warchus described the show as "an intelligent mainstream Broadway classic" that was ideal for the Old Vic.

He added that the film had made him laugh and cry. "It is really about how little time you have to become the best version of yourself. It''s sophisticated meaty stuff in a romantic comedy package."

Solar Impulse was only supposed to stay a few hours in Chongqing after arriving from Myanmar (Burma), but poor weather grounded the plane for three weeks.
The team is now confident conditions will remain fair for the Nanjing leg.
Getting to the east of the country would set up the project for its greatest challenge yet - a five-day, five-night crossing to Hawaii.
The latest leg saw Solar Impulse leave the runway at Chongqing International Airport at just after 06:00 local time, Tuesday (22:00 GMT, Monday). Project chairman, Bertrand Piccard, is again at the controls of the single-seater aircraft.
He is taking it in turns with CEO Andre Borschberg. But as the engineer in the partnership, Borschberg wants to do the Hawaii leg, so Piccard has elected to do both Chinese stages.

The therapy trains people to focus their minds and understand that negative thoughts may come and go.
In England and Wales doctors are already encouraged to offer it.
Patients who have had recurrent clinical depression are often prescribed long-term anti-depressant drugs to help prevent further episodes.
In this study, UK scientists enrolled 212 people who were at risk of further depression on a course of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) while carefully reducing their medication.
Patients took part in group sessions where they learned guided meditation and mindfulness skills.
The therapy aimed to help people focus on the present, recognise any early warning signs of depression and respond to them in ways that did not trigger further reoccurrences.
Researchers compared these results to 212 people who continued to take a full course of medication over two years.
By the end of the study, a similar proportion of people had relapsed in both groups. And many in the MBCT group had been tapered off their medication.
Scientists say these findings suggest MBCT could provide a much-needed alternative for people who cannot or do not wish to take long-term drugs.
